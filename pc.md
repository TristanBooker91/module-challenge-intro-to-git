## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? - It's used for collobarative work amongst programmers and tracks any changes to said work.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? - I believe Git is more remote while GitHub is more cloud based.

3. Why do we create a branch? - Branches allows us to seperate changes from the main branch.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? - Lets others know about the changes you made to a branch.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. - git switch

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? - git fetch gets updates but doesn't merge them. git pull does a git fetch behind the scenes and then a merge.


7. What is a merge conflict? - It's when GIT is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between 2 commits.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? -Open the file and make the necessary changes.
